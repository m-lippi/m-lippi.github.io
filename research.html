						<h4>Human multi-robot workspace sharing</h4>

							In this work a solution to  human multi-robot safe coexistence is presented in which multiple mobile manipulators are in charge of performing a cooperative task in a workspace shared with human operators.
The safety of the interaction is assessed by a safety field that takes into account the whole system and is general enough concerning its expression.
Based on the value of this field, the cooperative task trajectory is properly modified so as to ensure a safe interaction while trying to preserve  as much as possible the nominal task, which is instead completely aborted whenever the safety of the interaction cannot be guaranteed.
The solution is first designed within a centralized architecture and, then, upon this,  
a distributed implementation is presented which, in general, aims to exhibit the same performance as the centralized counterpart.
Finally, both simulations and experiments on two Comau SmartSix corroborate the designed solution.

					<h4>Contact classification and reaction in human-robot physical interaction</h4>

						In this scenario  a robot is able to both
carry out autonomous tasks and to physically interact with a
human operator to achieve a common objective. Since
human and robot share the same workspace both accidental
and intentional contacts between them might arise. Therefore,
a solution based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
proposed to detect and classify the nature of the contact with
the human, even in the case the robot is interacting with the
environment because of its own task. Then, reaction strategies
are defined depending on the nature of contact: human avoid-
ance with evasive action in the case of accidental interaction,
and admittance control in the case of intentional interaction.
In regard to the latter, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are
considered to guarantee the satisfaction of robot constraints,
while endowing the robot with a compatible compliant behavior.

						The objective is to devise a general framework to allow a human operator to physically interact with an object manipulated by a multi-manipulator system in a distributed setting. 
						A two layer solution is devised. At the top layer  an optimal Linear Quadratic Tracking  problem is solved where both the human and  robots' intentions are taken into account, being the former online estimated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) technique. 
						The output of this layer is a desired trajectory of the object  which is the input of the bottom layer and from which desired trajectories for the robot end effectors are computed based on the closed-chain constraints. 
						Each robot, then, implements a  time-varying gain  adaptive control law  so as to take into account model uncertainty and internal wrenches. 
Simulations with three 6-DOFs serial chain manipulators mounted on mobile platforms corroborate the theoretical findings.

					<h4>Visual action planning for rigid and deformable object manipulation</h4>

						In this video, we present  a framework  for  visual  action  planning of complex manipulation tasks with high-dimensional state-spaces, such  as  manipulation  of  deformable  objects. 
						Planning  is performed  in  a  low-dimensional  latent  state  space  that  embeds images.  We  define  and  implement  a  Latent  Space  Roadmap (LSR)  which  is  a  graph-based  structure  that  globally  captures the latent system dynamics. 
						Our framework consists of two main components:  a  Visual  Foresight  Module  (VFM)  that  generates a  visual  plan  as  a  sequence  of  images,  
						and  an  Action  Proposal Network (APN) that predicts the actions between them. We show the effectiveness of the method on a simulated box stacking taskas  
						well  as  a  T-shirt  folding  task  performed  with  a  Baxter  robot.

					<h4>Benchmarking bimanual cloth manipulation </h4>

						Cloth manipulation is a challenging task that, despite its importance, has received relatively little attention compared to rigid object manipulation. In this letter, we provide three benchmarks for evaluation and comparison of different approaches towards three basic tasks in cloth manipulation: spreading a tablecloth over a table, folding a towel, and dressing. The tasks can be executed on any bimanual robotic platform and the objects involved in the tasks are standardized and easy to acquire. We provide several complexity levels for each task, and describe the quality measures to evaluate task execution. Furthermore, we provide baseline solutions for all the tasks and evaluate them according to the proposed metrics.

					<h4>Distributed fault detection and isolation</h4>

					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						The problem of defining a Distributed Fault Detection and Isolation strategy for a team of mobile manipulators performing a cooperative mission is addressed. 
						The overall system relies on an observer-controller scheme, where each robot estimates the global state of the team through a distributed observer requiring 
						information exchange with the direct neighbor robots; then, the global state estimate is used by each robot to compute the estimated local input so as to achieve 
						a specific task. The observer-controller scheme also allows to define a set of residual vectors that can be used by the robots to detect and isolate faults 
						affecting anyone of the teammates, even if not in direct communication, without increasing the computational burden and the information exchange. 
						The approach is validated with a heterogeneous team of three robots perform a cooperative task.
